<h2>Agentic AI Engineer | Python . LangChain . LangGraph . LLMs . FastAPI . GCP</h2>

Skilled AI Python developer with a strong foundation in building intelligent backend systems using FastAPI, LangChain, LangGraph, and AI agents. I turn complex AI workflows into clean, production-ready applications—bringing LLMs to life through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent orchestration, and API development.

What sets me apart is my ability to learn fast, build independently, and ship real results. I've developed a growing portfolio of hands-on projects that solve real problems using modern AI tools—all backed by deep Python expertise and continuous learning from top-tier programs.

I'm currently seeking opportunities to contribute to cutting-edge AI products, collaborate with experienced professionals, and continue growing as a backend AI developer.

⚡ Whether you’re building AI agents, LLM-powered APIs, or backend services that need brains—I’m ready to jump in, contribute meaningfully, and grow with your team.

If you're building smart systems with Python and AI—let’s connect!
